# Overseas Trip to Tokyo

Website for more information: [Live Japan](https://livejapan.com/ja/in-tokyo/in-pref-chiba/in-narita/spot-lj0000001/)

## Accommodation

- <b>Tokyo Stay: ANA InterContinential</b>
We have a very pleasant experience in ANA InterContinential. The hotel is located in the heart of Tokyo, and it's very convenient for us to go out and explore the city. The location of the hotel is also very convenient to get to the train station, Tamemi-sando Station, which is a 5 minutes walk from the hotel. 
The hotel staffis very friendly and helpful, and they always go out of their way to make sure we have a comfortable stay.
There are various convenience stores nearby - Family Mart, Lawson, selling cheap and nice food and drinks.

- <b>Mount Fuji Stay: Hotel Ookie</b>

## Transportation

- <u><b>Tokyo Metro Train</b></u>
  Travelling on the train is the most convenient way to travel around Tokyo. The train stations are well connected and it's very easy to get from one station to another. 
  We have used the Tokyo Metro Train extensively during our stay, and it has been a great experience.
  The train stations are also very clean and well-maintained, and it's easy to find your way around.
  Though there are many train stations and that requires you to change to different lines to reach your destination, it's always a good idea to check the schedule before you leave your station as there are times when trains may be delayed.

  Apps like <b>Google Maps</b> and <b>Citymapper</b> are very useful when it comes to navigating around Tokyo. They provide real-time information on train schedules, bus timings, and other forms of transportation.
<br>
- <u><b>Driving</b></u>
  Driving in the city area is not advisable as the roads are very crowded and the traffic is heavy, especially during the peak hours. However, if you are to travel out of Tokyo city area, it can be one of the methods, especially travelling with young children.
  You can rent the car from the hotel, or they have car rental companies located in various parts of the city.
<br>
  - <b>Things to take note:</b>
    - International driving license is required for Singaporeans. You can apply for the International Driving License online or at the physical counter
    - When making the car rental booking online, make sure that you request for ETC (Electronic Toll Collection) as it is mandatory in Japan. It will save you a lot of time and hassle when driving around the city. You will need to pay for the usage of the toll after finishing the rental.
    Also, if you are travelling during Autumn/Winter, remember to request for a snow tire kit as the roads can be slippery and icy.
    - Follow the speed limit and be aware of the traffic rules.
    - Seatbelts are mandatory for all passengers, including children.
    - Do drive very carefully on expressways outside Toyko city area, as the roads may not be lit.
    - Car rental companies in Japan requires you to have a local phone number. This is for in an case of emergency to contact you. They will ask you to provide and try calling you on the spot.
    - GPS in the car ma not be in English, so Google Maps will come in handy. 
    - Parking in the city area is very expensive, therefore not advisable to drivearound the city area.
    - Drivers will be on the right hand side of the car, similar to how Singapore cars are driven.
<br>
- <u><b>Airport Transfers</b></u>
  They do have cheap airport transfers, but it is recommended to book in advance as they can be limited during peak times. The travelling will be around the same as taking the train, however, the airport transfer will be more convenient as the bus driver will help you with loading and unloading the luggage onto the bus, and also ensuring that you reach the hotel.
  - Book your airport transfer through the airport's official website or a reputable travel agency ([Klook](https://www.klook.com), [KKday](https://www.kkday.com/en-sg), [JP Limousine Bus](https://webservice.limousinebus.co.jp/web/jp/Top.aspx))
  - Do not book airport transfers through unofficial or unknown websites as they may be scams.
  - Check whether the airport transfer goes to your accommodation, as some transfers may drop off at a different location.

<b>P.S.</b> - If you are planning to bring your scroller with you during the trip, you may want to think twice, as there are a lot of staircases when travelling on the trains.

<p>
This attraction is one of the highlights of the trip for us, as kids will love this place. It is very similar to Disneyland, but it's more affordable and located in the heart of Tokyo.

All the characters from Sanrio will be there - Hello Kitty, My Melody, Cinnamon Roll, and many more. It's a great place for kids to have fun and play with their favorite characters.

If you are worried about weather, not to worry, as it is all indoors and there are plenty of places to play, even if it rains. It is a 4-5 stories high building over a very large area.
