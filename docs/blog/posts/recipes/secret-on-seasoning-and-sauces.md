It is very important for you to taste your food, as it can be difficult to know if something is cooked correctly without tasting it. 

However, everyone has a different taste preference, and what works for one person may not work for another. That's why it is important to experiment with different seasoning combinations until you find the ones that work best for you.

1. <b>Know your ingredients</b>
   The first step in seasoning your food is to choose the right ingredients. You should choose fresh, high-quality ingredients whenever possible. This will ensure that your food tastes delicious and authentic.
   By chossing your ingredients, you will need to understand how individual ingredient taste and how they interact with other ingredients. For example: certain spices can enhance the flavor of a dish, while others can mask it. Also certain ingredient gives a sweet taste, while others give a sour taste. 

2. <b>Season your food the right way</b>
    The next step is to season your food. This involves adding salt, pepper, and other seasonings to your food. You should add these seasonings in small amounts at first, and then gradually increase. Not only do you add in small amounts first, you will need to constantly taste your food at different time during the cooking process. This will ensure that you can and will able to achieve the taste that you want. For example: The taste for soup will be different at the start of the cooking process comparing to the end. This is because the longer you boil the soup, the taste of the soup intensifies. If you add the seasoning too early, it will be difficult for you to adjust in the end.

3. <b>Use ingredients to help each other to taste better</b> 
   The next step is to use ingredients to help each other to taste better. This involves using different types of ingredients together. For example: Naturally tomatoes taste fruity with a bit of sourness. So when cooking the tomato-based pasta sauce, you can use sugar or ingredients that gives sweetness to counter-act the sourness of the tomatoes. Similarly, naturally carrots taste sweet with a bit of bitterness. So when cooking the carrot-based soup, you can use vinegar or ingredients that gives acidity to counter-act the bitterness of the carrots.

4. <b>Use herbs and spices to add flavor</b> 
    Herbs and spices are another great way to add flavor to your dishes. They give dishes the extra herb after taste. They also elevate the dishes, giving it the aroma and flavour. For example: Mint is always used with lamb dishes in Western cuisine. This is because the minty flavour can mask the gamey taste from the lamb, and add tangyness to the dish. Similarly, garlic is used with chicken dishes in Chinese cuisine. This is because the garlicy flavour can mask the salty taste from the chicken, and add sweetness to the dish.

There are a lot of points on why we need to taste our food, but I think the most important point, is so that the receipient of the food will enjoy eating the dishes. 

What this post is trying to tell you (if you are reading this post), is that it's not enough to just taste your food. You should also consider how the food tastes with different herbs and spices. This way, you can make sure that the receipient of the food will enjoy eating the dishes. Keep experiening with different ingredients, seasoning and sauces. Never stop trying new things! 

Cooking with love and care is the key to making your dishes taste amazing. Enjoy cooking! üçΩÔ∏è
