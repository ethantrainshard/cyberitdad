# How to use the recipes in this site

Hello! You may have stumbled across this site, or recommended by someone (probably me!) to pay a visit! No matter how, welcome!

<!-- more -->
The recipes in this site are from the my memory, and I used them to cook for my family and friends. So I hope you enjoy using them as much as I did.

If you take a look at the recipes, they have the list of ingredients and instructions on how to prepare each dish. You can find the recipes in the following sections:

- Ingredients
- Instructions

However, something that you will not see in the recipes are the amount of seasoning, ingredients for each dish. It is not because I'm lazy. It is because in Asian cooking, we always base all the tasting on our feelings. If we feel that it needs more salt, we put more salt. If we feel that we need more sweetness, we add more sugar or something sweet. All based on feeling :)

Another thing I want to mention is that I have created this site in mind is to:

- Share knowledge that I have learnt and experienced through the years
- Quick and easy recipes for people who wants to try and learn to cook
- Healthy recipes that are easy to make for kids
- Guys, husbands, dads who want to whip something for the family but don't know how

I hope you enjoy using this site to help you achieve what you want to achieve as much as I did. Happy cooking! üçΩÔ∏è
