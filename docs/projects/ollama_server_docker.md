# Project: Ollama Server Docker

##### Github: [ollama-server-docker](https://github.com/ethantrainshard/ollama-server-docker)

## Description

This project is a Docker container for running an Ollama language model server. The server can be used for various tasks such as text generation, question answering, and more.

Ollama has its official docker image on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ollama/ollama-server). However, for this project, I have created a custom Dockerfile to build the server using its installation script. This allows any organisation or person to create their own Ollama server without having to get the Ollama Docker image from Docker Hub, which may be a restriction to some.

## Usage

To use this project, you can deploy it in any cloud environment that supports Docker. I would advise to build the image, upload the image to the repository of your choice, and then to use Docker Compose or Kubernetes to manage the deployment.

Apart from just deploying in a container, do remember to set up the necessary security configuration such as SSL certificates, proxy managers, firewalls etc. and load balancers to protect the server from potential threats, since it will be exposed to the internet.
