# Setting Up Docker and Environments for Local Development

As a Developer, I have learnt that we can do a lot of things on the local machine. We can develop, run containers, and test our applications without having to deploy them to a production environment. For this reason, I have created this guide to help you set up Docker, tools and environments for local development. Keep in mind that these are some of the tools that I use, but there are many other options available out there.

Setting up a local machine may be a daunting task based on the device that you are using. For example, I have tried to use a MacBook to perform forensics during my Uni days, and I almost gave up. So setting up with the tools you are comfortable with on the right devices, will help make your life and learning simpler and more productive.

## Prerequisites
- You will need to have a desktop/laptop, that is powerful enough for your to develop, create and test applications.
- A curious mind, as you will be learning new things every day, and searching for solutions to problems.

## Tools and Applications

These are the tools that I have been using since the start of my journey. They are not the only ones available out there, but they are the ones that I find most useful:

- [**Docker**](docker.md) - A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.
- [**VS Code**](vscode.md) - A source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring. Comes with a variety of extensions that can be installed from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
- [**PyEnv**](pyenv.md) - A simple Python version management tool.
- [**Poetry**](poetry.md) - A packaging and dependency management library for Python.
- **Git**- A distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project without interfering with each other's work. **(WIP)**
- [**UV**](uv.md) - Similar to Poetry, it is a packaging and dependency management library for Python, but faster and more efficient.
- **Notion** - A productivity platform that combines note-taking, task management, and project collaboration into one place. It allows users to create and organize notes, tasks, and projects in a visual way, making it easier to stay organized and focused. **(WIP)**
